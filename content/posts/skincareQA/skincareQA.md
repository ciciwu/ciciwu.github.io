The third times I look up Paraben during my skin product shopping, I know my brain is not remembering these long chemical name well. As an fun idea, what about using deep neural network to extend my memory?
This project I explored utilizing GPT2 as pretained model to develop a simple skin care ingredient Q&A webapp.

## Update Apr 4 Features:
Trained( or tuned) GPT2 with the text focusing on skin care ingredients - model M2.
Webapp takes in one ingredient and answer with existing GPT-2, and M2.
